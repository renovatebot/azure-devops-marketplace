  "description": "This task automates the process of documenting Dataverse table relationships. By parsing relationship data from XML files, it generates Markdown documentation that details relationships between tables, including one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many associations. Choose between outputting the documentation into a single file or individual files for each table, making it easier to manage and understand the relationships within your Dataverse environment.",

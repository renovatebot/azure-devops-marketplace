  "description": "This task simplifies the process of creating documentation for role permissions in Dataverse. It gathers information from XML files in the Roles folder of a project and automatically creates easy-to-read tables in Markdown format. Users can choose where to save the files and whether to combine all the roles into one document or keep them as separate files. This makes it easier to review and manage role permissions, ensuring the documentation is organized and accessible for security and role management purposes.",

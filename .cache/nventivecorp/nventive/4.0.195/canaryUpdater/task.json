The update is split in 3 phases :\n - Optional: merge of the canary branch with a given target branch (usually master) \n - Update of the NuGet packages; the versions used by the updater are calculated through the branch name (canaries/dev for dev, canaries/beta+dev for beta and stable, etc.); stable is always appended to the versions. \n - Optional: commit the changes and push the changes.",
